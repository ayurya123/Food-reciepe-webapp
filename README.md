The food ingredient website is a convenient platform that allows users to explore and discover new dishes based on the ingredients they have on hand. By leveraging third-party APIs, the website provides personalized recipe recommendations tailored to the user's input. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates with YouTube channels to offer video tutorials for each recommended dish, enhancing the user's culinary experience.

Functionality:

1.Ingredient Recognition: Users can input a list of ingredients they have available, either by typing them manually or using voice input. The website utilizes advanced ingredient recognition algorithms powered by third-party APIs to identify the ingredients accurately.

2.Recipe Recommendations: Based on the user's input, the website generates a list of recommended dishes that can be prepared using the provided ingredients. Each recommendation includes a brief description of the dish, along with a link to view the full recipe.

3.YouTube Integration: For each recommended dish, the website fetches video tutorials from relevant YouTube channels using the YouTube Data API. Users can watch step-by-step cooking demonstrations directly from the website or be redirected to the corresponding YouTube channel for more detailed instructions.

4.User Interaction: Users can interact with the website by saving favorite recipes, rating dishes they have tried, and leaving comments or reviews. These interactions help improve the personalized recommendation algorithm over time.
